# 📋 Quick Start: Upload to GitHub

## 🎯 Fast Track (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/new
- Name: `docuflow`
- Description: "Smart Document Management System"
- **Don't** initialize with README
- Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Open PowerShell in Project Root
```powershell
cd "E:\Ruchika TE\Docuflow"
```

### Step 3: Initialize Git and Commit
```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: DocuFlow Document Management System"
```

### Step 4: Connect to GitHub
**Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username:**
```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/docuflow.git
git branch -M main
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub
```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted for credentials:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: use a Personal Access Token (not your password!)
